**Lane Detection MMAE**
* The purpose of this project is making a robust lane detection/keeping algorithm based on different multiple CV models for lane detection.
* Front and Back Camera data from AirSim simulation environment is used for detecting the lanes.
* Three different models for detecting lanes are used which are based on computer vision and also deep learning.
* Extended Kalman Filter is used for Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation.
* The final output of all the models is the offset between the center of lane and vehicle.
* A PID controller is used for controlling the steering.
